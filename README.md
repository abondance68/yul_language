# **yul_language**<br>
**YUL is a low level language close to bare metal in contrary to Vyper or Solidity languages that are high level languages.**<br>

**We create a smart contract that is just adding one number**


**We create a build folder, a test folder and a script folder.**<br>


**To compile the contract :**<br>
```
node compile/compile.js
```

**To deploy the contract :**<br>
```
node scripts/deploy.js
```

**To test the contract :**<br>
```
node test/PureYul.test.js
```



#**The original smart contract coded in solidity is illustrated with solidity.svg.**#
